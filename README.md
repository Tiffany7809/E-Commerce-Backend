  <h2 id="describe">Description</h2>

  This is an express application run from the terminal that is connected to a database to maintain and keep track of the backend of an E-commerce site.

  To the E-Commerce sites backend easy and convienent to manipulate. 

  .

  Through this application I learned how to use MySQL, Express and dotenv. I became more comfertable manipulating tables and columns in a database. .

  .

  In the future I would like to connect the backend application to a front end user facing application..
